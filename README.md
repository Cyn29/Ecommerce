# Project Description üì£

A tus pies, a marketplace that redefines the way we experience fashion and footwear. Our platform focuses on sneakers of all styles, making it easy to buy and sell new and/or second-hand products, creating a space where sustainability and style converge.

## System Requirements üîé

Make sure you have the following requirements installed in your development environment before getting started:

- Node.js and NPM: You must have Node.js installed on your system as it is used to run Vite, manage dependencies, and execute scripts.

  - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- Vite: This project uses Vite as the development environment. Ensure you have Vite installed globally or as a development dependency.

  - Download and install Vite from [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/).

  - Install Vite globally (optional).

  - Install Vite locally (recommended for specific projects).

- React, React Bootstrap, and Mdb Bootstrap: The project is based on React and uses React Bootstrap and Mdb Bootstrap for the user interface. Make sure you have React, React Bootstrap, and Mdb Bootstrap installed as dependencies.

  - Add React, React Bootstrap, and Mdb Bootstrap to your project (if not already done).

  - Visit [react.dev](https://react.dev/), [react-bootstrap.netlify.app](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/), and [mdbbootstrap](https://mdbbootstrap.com/) for more information.

- `package.json` File: Ensure you have a valid `package.json` file at the root of your project. This file should contain information about dependencies and necessary scripts.

  - If you don't have a `package.json` file, you can create one following the complete guide at [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).

- Start the server with `npm install -g json-server`.

- React Testing: If you want to run tests on your project, make sure you have the appropriate tools installed.

  - To run tests with React, you can use React Testing Library.

  - Install React Testing Library as a development dependency: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/dom`.

Once you've confirmed that you meet these requirements, you can proceed to set up and run the "At Your Feet" project smoothly. Make sure to keep this section updated as our project evolves.
